# **FPGA-SpaceLink: FPGA Integration for ISS (International Space Station)**

FPGA-SpaceLink is an innovative project dedicated to integrating Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) into the International Space Station (ISS) to support critical applications such as communication, video processing, and cosmic/solar radiation sensing. The project also investigates cutting-edge quantum-based techniques for radiation mitigation and propulsion designs inspired by the Parker Solar Probe.

Verilog notes & Processing signals in FPGA: To define video_data as an 8-bit bus. This way, when connecting it or extracting its bits (for example, during the instantiation of the tmds_encoder), the "cannot index an array" error does not occur since it is not an array of elements but a vector.

Connection in the tmds_encoder:
Instead of using video_data[7:0] (which could be misinterpreted if video_data were an array), the video_data signal is connected directly. This assumes that video_data is already an 8-bit vector.

Connection in the hdmi_module:
The tmds_encoded signal (output from the tmds_encoder) is used to transmit the HDMI data. This is consistent with the processing flow:

thermal_to_video generates video_data (8 bits).
tmds_encoder encodes that data and produces tmds_encoded (for example, 10 bits).
hdmi_module uses the encoded signal to generate the TMDS outputs.
With these changes, the error is corrected and a coherent signal flow within the module is established. Also, make sure that the instantiated modules (such as camera_module, thermal_to_video, tmds_encoder, hdmi_module, disp_hex_mux, and db_fsm) are correctly defined in your project or added as sources.

## Overview

This project focuses on integrating **Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** into the **International Space Station (ISS)** for applications including:

- **Communication Modules**
- **Video Processing and Camera Systems**
- **Cosmic and Solar Radiation Sensors**

Key challenges include addressing **radiation resistance, power efficiency,** and the **extreme environmental conditions** encountered in space. Additionally, the project explores:

- **Quantum-based techniques** for advanced radiation mitigation.
- **Engine designs inspired by the Parker Solar Probe** to boost system efficiency in harsh conditions.

## FPGA Selection for Space Applications

For **Earth-based prototyping**, we use the **Xilinx ZCU102 (Zynq UltraScale+)** because it offers:
- âœ… **Integrated ARM processor** for sensor control and data processing.
- âœ… **Ethernet, GPIO, and PCIe support** for high-speed communications.
- âœ… **Video processing capabilities** suitable for camera integration.

For **actual deployment in space**, the following radiation-tolerant FPGAs are considered:
- **Xilinx Kintex UltraScale XQRKU060**
- **Microchip (Microsemi) RTG4**
- **Xilinx Virtex-5QV**
- ## Constraints BCD counter_leds
- ## Adjust your own constraints file to the ZCU102 manual 
- ## or https://www.ic-xilinx.com/files/ca/ek-u1-zcu106-g-j.pdf as you see fit. 
- ## It can also be used to simulate signals or sinusoids in Python and BCD byte counters (resources)

//To integrate the External High Definition Camera (EHDC) with your ZCU106 board in the ISS communication system, here are some key points to consider:
//Video Compatibility: The EHDC uses H.264 compression with an MPEG2 transport stream for HD video (720P60). The ZCU106 is capable of handling these video formats, which is a good starting point.
//Ethernet Interface: The EHDC communicates via Ethernet based on EWC (802.11n, 5.2 GHz). The ZCU106 has Ethernet interface capabilities that can be used for this integration.
//Power Requirements: The EHDC has a power limit of less than 200W. Ensure that your power system on the ZCU106 can handle this requirement.
//Control and Telemetry: The EHDC requires automatic control (iris, focus, gain, white balance, etc.) with manual override, as well as telemetry and metadata. The programmable logic on the ZCU106 can be used to implement these controls.

//Connectors and Expansion: Use the FMC-HPC connectors on the ZCU106 to expand the inputs and outputs, allowing the connection of multiple sensors and cameras.
//Video Compression: The ZCU106 has a Video Codec Unit (VCU) that can be used for H.264 compression, which is compatible with the EHDC requirements.
