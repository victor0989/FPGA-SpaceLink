## Overview

This project focuses on integrating **Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** into the **International Space Station (ISS)** for applications including:

- **Communication Modules**
- **Video Processing and Camera Systems**
- **Cosmic and Solar Radiation Sensors**

Key challenges include addressing **radiation resistance, power efficiency,** and the **extreme environmental conditions** encountered in space. Additionally, the project explores:

- **Quantum-based techniques** for advanced radiation mitigation.
- **Engine designs inspired by the Parker Solar Probe** to boost system efficiency in harsh conditions.

## FPGA Selection for Space Applications

For **Earth-based prototyping**, we use the **Xilinx ZCU102 (Zynq UltraScale+)** because it offers:
- âœ… **Integrated ARM processor** for sensor control and data processing.
- âœ… **Ethernet, GPIO, and PCIe support** for high-speed communications.
- âœ… **Video processing capabilities** suitable for camera integration.

For **actual deployment in space**, the following radiation-tolerant FPGAs are considered:
- **Xilinx Kintex UltraScale XQRKU060**
- **Microchip (Microsemi) RTG4**
- **Xilinx Virtex-5QV**
