# **FPGA-SpaceLink: FPGA Integration for ISS (International Space Station)**

## Overview

This project focuses on integrating **Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)** into the **International Space Station (ISS)** for applications in:
- **Communication Modules**
- **Video Processing and Camera Systems**
- **Cosmic and Solar Radiation Sensors**

The primary challenges in this integration include **radiation resistance, power efficiency, and extreme environmental conditions** in space.

Additionally, we explore **innovative quantum-based techniques** for radiation mitigation and **engine designs inspired by the Parker Solar Probe** to improve efficiency in extreme environments.

## üöÄ FPGA Selection for Space Applications

For **Earth-based prototyping**, we use the **Xilinx ZCU102 (Zynq UltraScale+)** due to its:
- ‚úÖ **Integrated ARM processor** for sensor control and data processing.
- ‚úÖ **Ethernet, GPIO, and PCIe support** for communication and high-speed data transfer.
- ‚úÖ **Video processing capabilities** for camera integration.

For **actual deployment in space**, radiation-tolerant FPGAs are required, such as:
- **Xilinx Kintex UltraScale XQRKU060**
- **Microchip (Microsemi) RTG4**
- **Xilinx Virtex-5QV**

## üîß FPGA Programming & Constraints

We define FPGA pin assignments using a **.xdc constraint file**.

### Example: Basic Constraints for LEDs and GPIO
```tcl
set_property PACKAGE_PIN L18 [get_ports LED]
set_property IOSTANDARD LVCMOS18 [get_ports LED]

üåå Cosmic Radiation Sensor Integration
Radiation Challenges & Quantum Innovations
Radiation in space can cause Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in FPGAs. This project explores quantum-based shielding techniques and advanced error correction algorithms to mitigate these effects.

Radiation sensors used for this project include:

TE Connectivity RADFETs (for monitoring accumulated radiation dose).
AMS TID Sensors (for detecting ionizing radiation).
Timepix3 (CERN) (advanced particle tracking sensor).
Integration Steps
Connect sensors to the FPGA via I2C or SPI.
Filter and process the sensor signals using FPGA digital logic and DSP blocks.
Transmit the data via Ethernet or SpaceWire to the ISS communication modules.

üé• Video and Communication Integration
Video Processing for ISS
For video processing, the ZCU102 implements a video pipeline:

MIPI CSI or HDMI IN: Capture video from cameras.
FPGA Processing: Apply filters, compression, or other image processing algorithms.
Ethernet or SpaceWire: Transmit the processed images to monitoring stations.
Communication Protocols
For space communications, we also integrate the SpaceWire protocol, which is widely used in satellites and the ISS for reliable, high-speed data transfer.
