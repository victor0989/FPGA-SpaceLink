To integrate the External High Definition Camera (EHDC) with your ZCU106 board in the ISS communication system, here are some key points to consider:

Video Compatibility: The EHDC uses H.264 compression with an MPEG2 transport stream for HD video (720P60). The ZCU106 is capable of handling these video formats, which is a good starting point.

Ethernet Interface: The EHDC communicates via Ethernet based on EWC (802.11n, 5.2 GHz). The ZCU106 has Ethernet interface capabilities that can be used for this integration.

Power Requirements: The EHDC has a power limit of less than 200W. Ensure that your power system on the ZCU106 can handle this requirement.

Control and Telemetry: The EHDC requires automatic control (iris, focus, gain, white balance, etc.) with manual override, as well as telemetry and metadata. The programmable logic on the ZCU106 can be used to implement these controls.

Connectors and Expansion: Use the FMC-HPC connectors on the ZCU106 to expand the inputs and outputs, allowing the connection of multiple sensors and cameras.

Video Compression: The ZCU106 has a Video Codec Unit (VCU) that can be used for H.264 compression, which is compatible with the EHDC requirements.
