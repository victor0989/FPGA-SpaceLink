EHDC Components Overview
Power Control: Allows operator control to reset power to components in the event of a detected Single Event Upset (SEU) and controls standby mode (camera & encoder turned off).

Status Telemetry: Monitors temperature, pressure, and currents.

Watchdog Timer: Ensures system reliability by resetting the system in case of a malfunction.

Control Camera Zoom Lens Function: Manages the zoom lens of the camera.

Video Encoder: Uses the AVN443HD Encoder from Visionary Solutions Incorporated (VSI), which provides HD H.264 encoding with a bit rate range of 5-20 Mbps, nominally set to 8 Mbps.

Power Supply: The primary power supply is 120 VDC, which is converted to 24 VDC. A secondary board provides separate power supplies for each component1.

Heaters: Thermostat-controlled heaters are used to maintain optimal operating temperatures.

Compatibility with ISS
Power Sharing: The EHDC shares power with the Luminaire heater power, utilizing 120 VDC directly from the input power.

Control and Communication: The EHDC is controlled from the Mission Control Center (MCC) and uses Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware.

Installation: The EHDC can be installed either during an Internal Spacewalk (IVA) or an Extravehicular Activity (EVA).

Video Output: Provides standard HD video (720P60) and uses H.264 compression with MPEG2 transport stream.

Wireless Communication: Conforms to EWC wireless Ethernet-based communications (802.11n, 5.2 GHz) and is WiFi compatible through the ISS Joint Station LAN (JSL).
