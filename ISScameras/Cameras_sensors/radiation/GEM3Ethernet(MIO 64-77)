GEM3 Ethernet (MIO 64-77)
 [Figure 2-1, callout 12]
 The PS-side Gigabit Ethernet MAC (GEM) implements a 10/100/1000 Mb/s Ethernet 
interface (see Figure 3-12), which connects to a TI DP83867IRPAP Ethernet RGMII PHY 
before being routed to an RJ45 Ethernet connector. The RGMII Ethernet PHY is boot 
strapped to PHY address 5'b01100 (0x0C) and Auto Negotiation is set to Enable. 
Communication with the device is covered in the DP83867 RGMII PHY data sheet [Ref 20].

 10/100/1000 MHz Tri-Speed Ethernet PHY
 [Figure 2-1, callout 12]
 The ZCU106 board uses the TIDP83867IRPAP Ethernet RGMII PHY [Ref 20] (U98) for 
Ethernet communications at 10 Mb/s, 100 Mb/s, or 1000 Mb/s. The board supports RGMII 
mode only. The PHY connection to a user-provided Ethernet cable is through a Wurth 
7499111221A RJ-45 connector (P12) with built-in magnetics.
 The Ethernet connections from XCZU7EV MPSoC U1 to the DP83867IRPAP PHY device at 
U98 are listed in Table 3-14.
